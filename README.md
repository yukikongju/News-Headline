### About this project
The media is often scrutinized for its sensationalism and its overall
pessimistic view of the world. The goal of this project is to confirm or deny
these affirmations. Are the reported news that bad?

This project is separated in 4 parts:
1. Web Scrape the Headlines from the last year or so
2. Give the biggest trend of the day, week, month
3. Perform a sentiment analysis to determine if the news are happy or sad
4. Perform a clickbait analysis to determine if the headline is clickbait or
   not
5. Perform theme analysis to discover which news are the most covered
